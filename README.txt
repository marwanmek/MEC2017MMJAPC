On completion of Day 1 of today's competition, we were able to complete a basic GUI for our irrigation system design.
Features we would add to improve our design are:
	A working auto-watering function that would automatically water the plants
	A working watering function
	Change watering dependant on plant maturity and preferences
	Error messages for extreme water levels
	Measuring water consumption rates to report anomalies (dead or sick crops)
	Accounting for rainfall, accessing weather from databases
	Inputting custom crops and parameters
